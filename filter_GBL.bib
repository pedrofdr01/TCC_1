abstract = {Successful computer programming education is facing significant problems even nowadays for both students and teachers. To this end, the specificities of those difficulties and the corresponding causes continue to be an ongoing topic of research. According to relevant case studies, these relate to the complex concepts of computer programming as well as the lack of motivation by students to achieve the given goals. On the other hand, the emerging field of Games Based Learning is gradually delivering games that are applied in a series of educational contexts. In this paper, we aim to initially investigate the educational games developed for and used in the computer programming domain and review to which level they address the aforementioned difficulties. Related work includes a number of games that have been developed towards this goal. However, even though they seem promising examples, they lack features that would allow them to successfully underpin computer programming learning by facing the majority of the identified problems. To this end, we propose a new, advanced Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) that includes the facilitating and positive features identified in existing solutions and incorporates missing elements that will bring forth a new generation of educational games for introductory computer programming.},

abstract = {Reflection is a critical aspect of the learning process. However, educational games tend to focus on supporting learning concepts rather than supporting reflection. While reflection occurs in educational games, the educational game design and research community can benefit from more knowledge of how to facilitate player reflection through game design. In this paper, we examine educational programming games and analyze how reflection is currently supported. We find that current approaches prioritize accuracy over the individual learning process and often only support reflection post-gameplay. Our analysis identifies common reflective features, and we develop a set of open areas for future work. We discuss these promising directions towards engaging the community in developing more mechanics for reflection in educational games. },

abstract = {Besides the long-ago established importance of gameplay as a privileged framework for learning and socialization, which promotes equality alongside with acceptance of differences, motivation through challenge and absence of punishment in the case or errors, modern digital games enjoy a number of additional features such as their enhanced capability to simulate real-world and everyday-life situations in a straightforward fashion, as well as their ability to attract player's engagement through augmented playability mechanisms and balanced game feedback. All these features make digital games a most promising learning tool, in both formal and informal settings and for general and special education alike.This keynote talk will revolve around research practices and initiatives in the area of computer-based learning, conducted by the New Technologies Laboratory in Communication, Education and the Mass Media of the University of Athens. Major emphasis will be placed on the defined learning framework for a specialized formation program for primary, secondary and special education teachers supporting students with mild mental retardation (MMR) and on the research and development, along the lines of this framework, of digital games-based learning (DGBL) material for MMR students deployed and tested within the special classroom, as part of practical seminars and hands-on activities. This work is conducted in the context of the EPINOISI R&D project (http://www.media.uoa.gr/epinoisi).The digital games-based material for MMR students currently under development within the EPINOISI project is based on game applications already available as well as developed from scratch, covering subject matter relevant to language and mathematics skills for everyday life, interpersonal relations and communication, acquaintance with adult life, selected topics from the curriculum of secondary special education, as well as digital creative activities.},

abstract = {Learning games that address targeted curriculum areas are widely used in schools. Within games, productive learning episodes can result from breakdowns when followed by a breakthrough, yet their role in children's learning has not been investigated. This paper examines the role of game and instructional design during and after breakdowns. We observed 26 young children playing several popular learning games and conducted a moment-by-moment analysis of breakdown episodes. Our findings show children achieve productive breakthroughs independently less than half of the time. In particular, breakdowns caused by game actions are difficult for children to overcome independently and prevent engagement with the domain skills. Importantly, we identify specific instructional game components and their role in fostering strategies that result in successful breakthroughs. We conclude with intrinsic and extrinsic instructional design implications for both game designers and primary teachers to better enable children's games-based learning.},

abstract = {One of the methods of learning which considered effective is to apply technology as instructional media. Let alone viewing at the current phenomenon where elementary students have been able to operate gadgets such as smartphone and tablet. They use gadget to play games, but it tends to be less useful and make them lazy. This behavior could bring a negative impact on their achievements at school. In addition, this behavior also can inhibit children motor neurons development. Based on this phenomenon, a research is made to develop a game based learning application entitled Digital Game Based Learning using Augmented Reality (for Mathematics Learning. This application is developed as one of instructional media alternative. The purpose of this application is to sharpen counting ability as well as to train children motor nerve to become more active. This application is developed using Unity 3D. It utilizes multiple sensors such as gyroscope, accelerometer and also GPS to support location-based Augmented Reality technology. Methods that used to design this application are Hierarchy Plus Diagram Input Process Output (HIPO) and Flowchart. System testing is done using black-box testing, sampling method to obtain exact amount of testers, behavioral observation and interview. The result is showing 100% positive response from the tester. They claimed to be glad and enthusiastic to learn math using this game.},

abstract = {A common teaching and learning methodology involves one that delivers knowledge to learners within a classroom environment. With the enhancement of information technology, Web-based learning has been promoted as an alternative teaching and learning methodology. Digital games, an interactive piece of technology within the multimedia learning environment, could foster the learning process effectively and interestingly especially among young learners. Researchers and game designers have noted this promising technology and proposed some frameworks and models to foster multimedia learning environment. However, most of the models do not address the learning behavior in game design, which is important to facilitate learning process in game-based learning. In view of this, this paper focuses on proposing and discussing components that leverage the pedagogical aspects in designing game-based learning environment.},

abstract = {Today's Millennial students have changing preferences for education and work environments that negatively affect their enrollment and retention rates into university computer science programs. To better suit these preferences, and to improve CS educational techniques, teaching methods and tools outside of the traditional lecture sessions and textbooks must be explored and implemented. Currently, both serious games and collaborative classroom work, including pair programming, are the focus of studies meant to do just this. The proposed work deals with both serious games and student collaboration research, positing that educational games with collaborative elements (multiplayer games) will take advantage of the benefits offered by each of these areas, resulting in an educational game that demonstrates increased learning gains and student engagement above that of individual learning game experiences. Collaborative educational games and software also have the potential to solve many of the problems that collaborative work may pose to course instructors in terms of helping to regulate and evaluate student performance.},

abstract = {Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can be used to design game-based learning systems because it has the excellent ability of concept representation and reasoning. However, it can not (1) get new knowledge from existing data and (2) correct false transcendental knowledge by itself, which mars the game-based learning ability. This paper utilizes Hebbian learning rule to solve the first problem and uses unbalance degree to solve the second problem. As a result, the improved FCM has the ability of self-learning from both existing data and priori knowledge, and is more suitable for a game-based learning system. Based on the improved FCM, a novel game-based learning model is proposed, including a teacher submodel, a learner submodel and a set of learning mechanisms. The teacher submodel has the standard answers which can be deduced from the improved FCM. The learner submodel is bulit and adjusted according to the teacher's FCM, which reflects the learner's learning process. The learning mechanisms compute the difference between the outputs of the teacher submodel and the learner submodel, and control the whole game learning process according to the difference. Based on the proposed model, an automobile driving learning system is developed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our model validity in terms of controlling the learning process and the guiding learners learning.},

In this paper we present preliminary results from a pilot project to develop an educational game prototype on the subject of basic digital design, to be used in various digital systems courses at the undergraduate level. Our findings indicate that the game has the potential to improve student learning in and attitude toward digital design and electrical engineering.

New educational methodologies take full advantage of ICT in a mobile customized user-friendly environment, to support learning and stimulate individuals' potential. Unfortunately, technology-enhanced learning tools are not often designed with accessibility in mind, although they can greatly benefit the personal empowerment and inclusion of special-needs people. To address this gap, a Web platform has been created for delivering accessible games to people with Down syndrome. Since personalization, orderliness and positive reinforcement are crucial to learning in these subjects, the platform offers a personalized safe environment for learning, conforming to behavioral analysis principles. Learning analytics are incorporated in the platform for easy monitoring of student progress via Web interfaces. The participatory design driving the development of the learning platform allowed the customization of the games' discriminative stimuli, difficulty levels and reinforcement, as well as the creation of a game "engine" to easily set up new personalized exercises. These customization features make the game platform usable by a larger audience, including individuals with learning difficulties and autism.},

However, it is often difficult to instrument game mechanics so that they can be controlled to promote learning. Furthermore, even if this parameterization is possible, there is little knowledge of how to generate adaptive level progressions that optimize engagement and learning. We have taken the first step towards enabling adaptivity in an educational game for teaching fractions through the automatic generation of levels in a way that allows for multiple axes of mathematical and spatial difficulty to be controlled independently. We propose to expand on this work by developing a framework for representing conceptual knowledge. This framework will keep track of each player's knowledge, generate game levels that are tailored to the player's knowledge and skill level, and create progressions of these levels that allow players to learn new concepts through experimentation. We will compare multiple adaptive concept sequencing algorithms by evaluating their effects on player learning and engagement through multivariate tests with tens of thousands of players.},

Furthermore, even if this parameterization is possible, there is little knowledge of how to generate adaptive level progressions that optimize engagement and learning. We have taken the first step towards enabling adaptivity in an educational game for teaching fractions through the automatic generation of levels in a way that allows for multiple axes of mathematical and spatial difficulty to be controlled independently. We propose to expand on this work by developing a framework for representing conceptual knowledge. This framework will keep track of each player's knowledge, generate game levels that are tailored to the player's knowledge and skill level, and create progressions of these levels that allow players to learn new concepts through experimentation. We will compare multiple adaptive concept sequencing algorithms by evaluating their effects on player learning and engagement through multivariate tests with tens of thousands of players.},

abstract = {This paper presents insights about design practices that can lead to effective and fun games for learning, gleaned from interviews with experienced game developers. We based our approach on Sch\"{o}n's notion of practitioners evolving shared 'appreciation systems' for discussing and critiquing work, and aimed to gather and share some of game designers' 'appreciation system' for games and learning. The resulting insights provide valuable pointers to other designers in the CHI community crafting game-like experiences.},

abstract = {This session will explore different approaches to the use of computer game design in formal/informal learning environments. Game design is becoming a popular strategy for enhancing young people's interest and skills with computer technology, and for purposes ranging from deepening their understanding of scientific principles to fostering critical media literacy. The participants will present research findings that highlight similarities and differences in tools, pedagogies, purposes, and outcomes of game design activities. Game design is often presumed to be appealing to learners who ordinarily might not be motivated to learn through traditional instruction, and we will give particular attention to the significance of race, class, and gender in student engagement and learning through design.},
