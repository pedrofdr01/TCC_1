abstract = {Reflection is a critical aspect of the learning process. However, educational games tend to focus on supporting learning concepts rather than supporting reflection. While reflection occurs in educational games, the educational game design and research community can benefit from more knowledge of how to facilitate player reflection through game design. In this paper, we examine educational programming games and analyze how reflection is currently supported. We find that current approaches prioritize accuracy over the individual learning process and often only support reflection post-gameplay. Our analysis identifies common reflective features, and we develop a set of open areas for future work. We discuss these promising directions towards engaging the community in developing more mechanics for reflection in educational games. },

abstract = {One of the methods of learning which considered effective is to apply technology as instructional media. Let alone viewing at the current phenomenon where elementary students have been able to operate gadgets such as smartphone and tablet. They use gadget to play games, but it tends to be less useful and make them lazy. This behavior could bring a negative impact on their achievements at school. In addition, this behavior also can inhibit children motor neurons development. Based on this phenomenon, a research is made to develop a game based learning application entitled Digital Game Based Learning using Augmented Reality (for Mathematics Learning. This application is developed as one of instructional media alternative. The purpose of this application is to sharpen counting ability as well as to train children motor nerve to become more active. This application is developed using Unity 3D. It utilizes multiple sensors such as gyroscope, accelerometer and also GPS to support location-based Augmented Reality technology. Methods that used to design this application are Hierarchy Plus Diagram Input Process Output (HIPO) and Flowchart. System testing is done using black-box testing, sampling method to obtain exact amount of testers, behavioral observation and interview. The result is showing 100% positive response from the tester. They claimed to be glad and enthusiastic to learn math using this game.},

For this systematic review, 29 publications dating from 2000 through 2019 were studied to highlight the foci of this field of research. Although these studies reported effects of game-based learning on learning outcomes and instructional supports on argumentation skills, none of the publications reported specific instructional support and game elements associated with the learning outcomes. Modeling, reflection and feedback were the most commonly reported instructional support of argumentation game-based learning. Feedback, challenge, and collaboration were the most commonly reported game elements of argumentation game-based learning. In addition, high level of argumentation skills and engagement were the most commonly reported positive learning outcomes of argumentation game-based learning. The results of this study provide suggestions on how to design argumentation game-based learning.}

abstract = {Despite efforts for defining best practices for assessing Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) effectiveness, lack of scientific rigor is yet to be established. This has led to academics and educational practitioners doubting the quality of evidence and practical value of scientific research in educational settings. Hence, the present manuscript aims to test the feasibility of previously defined best practices by means of 3 feasibility studies: one in formal, one in health and one in corporate education. Results firstly show a more nuanced view on previously defined best practices regarding control groups: a) inclusion of an educational activity is not always desirable and depends on whether absolute or relative effectiveness is assessed and b) keeping instructional time equal in experimental and control group does not comply with the time efficiency outcome of DGBL. Secondly, several non-intervention related elements jeopardizing internal validity have been established: a) failed randomization, which can be tackled with blocked randomization and b) pre-test effects, which can be tackled with carefully piloted parallel versions of tests. Lastly, additional indicators for motivational and efficiency outcomes in a self-paced distance learning context have been established: a) motivation during/after the training should be expanded with motivation to start playing and b) time required to finish the training should be expended with time required to follow-up on learners. Recommendations in the present manuscript are not exhaustive or generalizable to all contexts, but do provide preliminary insights into feasible experimental designs for DGBL effectiveness studies.}

abstract = {Several previous studies have indicated that secondary school students face problems in digital situations. Digital citizenship is therefore an essential conception for fostering students' correct behaviour and safe daily life habits while using computer and communication technologies. However, scholars have indicated the challenges of promoting students' digital citizenship owing to the lack of opportunities to situate them in decision-making situations. The advancement of computer and multimedia technologies has encouraged an increasing number of studies on digital game-based learning, which provides students with opportunities to experience various situations, and to cope with problems encountered in daily life. Several previous studies have indicated that digital game-based learning environments with proper learning strategies might help students realize the importance and meaning of digital citizenship. To address this issue, this study proposes a formative assessment-based contextual gaming approach to guide students to make decisions and to monitor their learning during the gaming process. A digital game-based learning environment was developed based on this approach, and a quasi-experiment on the digital citizenship topic was conducted in northern Thailand to evaluate its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only enhanced the students’ digital citizenship behaviours, but also promoted their motivations and perceptions.}

abstract = {The traditional classroom teaching is monotonous based teaching techniques and it lacks interaction and students lose the curiosity to understand the purpose of studying the course. The learners anticipate new teaching techniques, digital assignment, and challenging assessment patterns. In higher education, various new teaching-learning process is introduced to engage the learners with motivations and kindle the practice of self-learning thereby paying the way for acquisition of better competency skills and knowledge. With the various innovations in ICT for higher-education, game based learning is one of the innovative teaching-learning strategies which gained interest in various universities. The paradigm shift of ICT is tangled with various teaching methodologies in-order to match the 21st- century learners. The game based learning for programming course stimulates the curiosity to learn and understand the programming concepts in a better way. It also suits all the types of learners in the classroom especially the slow learners. The purpose of choosing gaming as a teaching aid, the learners are so much interested and addicted to any form of gaming. Using this as opportunity and interest in higher education, the programming courses will surely yield better performances and motivate the learners for lifelong learning skills. This ongoing project is focused on developing game-based learning for programming courses for first-year undergraduate students of our university. All the first-year students of various departments undergo a Python programming language course during the first semester. This programming course delivers conventional classroom teaching with chalk/talk or powerpoint presentation equipped with a practical session for all the students in the laboratory. It is also embedded with game-based learning for few sessions. The topics from programming courses are developed as gaming platforms with stages and characters. This aids the students to acquire knowledge about a topic while playing games and interact with the gaming console. The gaming technology encourages the students to enhance their cognitive skills with coding and debugging skills, thereby enhancing their competency skills. The gaming technology binds the learners with motivation to enrich the performances and achieve the course learning outcome for the Python programming course. This gaming environment includes various levels with time durations and the scores acquired based on the completion of stages. The gaming phase includes activities like complete the code, drag and drop, debugging and guess the output. The learner’s scores are evaluated using rubrics metrics which are defined by the course instructors based on the course objectives. The total scores acquired from all the stages are analyzed using learning analytics. The Artificial Neural network, regression techniques are used to measure the learner’s performances and it is compared with the traditional teaching assessment process. This comparative study helps the academic curriculum to understand the impact of game-based learning for the Python course and the determination of the students to undergo such innovative teaching style in the classroom.}

As such, it can enhance the learning process and improve student participation. Towards this direction, this paper investigates how mobile learning and game-based learning can be utilized in higher education settings and analyzes the pedagogical affordance of their adoption. As a testbed for our research, we designed and implemented Quiz Time! which is an intelligent mobile game-based learning application for assessing and advancing learners' knowledge in the programming language C#. Quiz Time! employs an assessing knowledge module for testing the knowledge of learners, a vectorial-based recommendation module for proposing personalized collaboration in group playing, a dynamic fuzzy logic-based advice generator for tailored assistance to learners' profile and misconceptions, and a cognitive learner modeler supporting the aforementioned modules. Quiz Time! was used in a higher education institution for an academic semester and was evaluated by students and computer science experts using an established framework and the statistical hypothesis test. Regarding the evaluation results, the computer science experts validated the pedagogical adequacy of the application and the students highlighted its positive impact on learning and its usefulness. A major conclusion is that incorporating personalization and collaboration in mobile game-based learning can further assist students in higher education towards advancing their knowledge level.}

We used from a field method to collect the required data and complete the standard questionnaire. The study is a semi-experimental design with pretest-posttest design with the control group. The statistical population was 256,836 students of the first grade of elementary school students in the 2016-17 academic year. Sixty students (32 males and 28 females) were selected through a purposive method. Then, the subjects of the study were randomly allocated to the control and experimental groups, and a pre-test was performed from both groups. The experimental group was exposed to Misha and Kosha Game-Based Learnings, while we implemented the conventional teaching method to the control group. The measuring tool was the Inventory of School Motivation (ISM) questionnaire. The test has sufficient validity and reliability (α = 0.84). The covariance analysis test (MANCOVA) revealed that the experimental group had significantly higher scores for academic achievement motivation than the control group. Also, the results showed that the computer educational game impacted academic achievement motivation of elementary students. According to the results, the necessity of using computer-based games in elementary school students is felt. Therefore, it is necessary to find a more suitable place in the teachers' daily lesson plan. The results can be good for educators, instructional and game designers and researchers from implementation, design and research perspectives, respectively.}

Thus, there is a need to examine how individual differences affect learners' reactions to DGBL. Among various individual differences, the levels of gaming experience, which are associated with playing skills, have important effects. Thus, this study developed a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG)-based English learning environment and investigated how the levels of gaming experience affected learners' reactions to the developed MMORPG. A total of 45 sixth graders from an elementary school in northern Taiwan participated in this study and they were divided into high gaming-experience learners (HGEL) and low gaming-experience learners (LGEL) based on the participants' responses to a prior gaming experience questionnaire. A mixed method was employed to analyze both learners' quantitative log data and qualitative interview responses. The results from quantitative log data showed that the HGEL had better game achievement and higher game socialization than the LGEL, especially in terms of buying items, chatting, and teaming up with friends. Conversely, the LGEL needed more in-game assistance than the HGEL, especially for checking the task list and route map. The results from qualitative interview responses showed that the HGEL skipped most of the learning content while the LGEL paid full attention to the learning content. These findings demonstrate the understandings of the effects of individual differences, especially the levels of gaming experience, on learners’ reactions to DGBL. Based on such findings, we contribute to developing a framework and several design solutions, which can be used to implement personalized DGBL to accommodate the needs of learners with different levels of gaming experience.}
