abstract = {Research published by University of Rochester neuroscientists C. Shawn Green and Daphne Bavelier has grabbed national attention for suggesting that playing "action" video and computer games has the positive effect of enhancing student's visual selective attention. But that finding is just one small part of a more important message that all parents and educators need to hear: Video games are not the enemy, but the best opportunity we have to engage our kids in real learning.},

abstract = {Game-Based Learning is widespread among elementary school students. Consequences in academic achievement motivation have been studied frequently. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of the Game-Based Learnings on the academic achievement motivation of the elementary school students. We used from a field method to collect the required data and complete the standard questionnaire. The study is a semi-experimental design with pretest-posttest design with the control group. The statistical population was 256,836 students of the first grade of elementary school students in the 2016-17 academic year. Sixty students (32 males and 28 females) were selected through a purposive method. Then, the subjects of the study were randomly allocated to the control and experimental groups, and a pre-test was performed from both groups. The experimental group was exposed to Misha and Kosha Game-Based Learnings, while we implemented the conventional teaching method to the control group. The measuring tool was the Inventory of School Motivation (ISM) questionnaire. The test has sufficient validity and reliability (α = 0.84). The covariance analysis test (MANCOVA) revealed that the experimental group had significantly higher scores for academic achievement motivation than the control group. Also, the results showed that the computer educational game impacted academic achievement motivation of elementary students. According to the results, the necessity of using computer-based games in elementary school students is felt. Therefore, it is necessary to find a more suitable place in the teachers' daily lesson plan. The results can be good for educators, instructional and game designers and researchers from implementation, design and research perspectives, respectively.}

abstract = {Reflection is a critical aspect of the learning process. However, educational games tend to focus on supporting learning concepts rather than supporting reflection. While reflection occurs in educational games, the educational game design and research community can benefit from more knowledge of how to facilitate player reflection through game design. In this paper, we examine educational programming games and analyze how reflection is currently supported. We find that current approaches prioritize accuracy over the individual learning process and often only support reflection post-gameplay. Our analysis identifies common reflective features, and we develop a set of open areas for future work. We discuss these promising directions towards engaging the community in developing more mechanics for reflection in educational games. },

abstract = {One of the methods of learning which considered effective is to apply technology as instructional media. Let alone viewing at the current phenomenon where elementary students have been able to operate gadgets such as smartphone and tablet. They use gadget to play games, but it tends to be less useful and make them lazy. This behavior could bring a negative impact on their achievements at school. In addition, this behavior also can inhibit children motor neurons development. Based on this phenomenon, a research is made to develop a game based learning application entitled Digital Game Based Learning using Augmented Reality (for Mathematics Learning. This application is developed as one of instructional media alternative. The purpose of this application is to sharpen counting ability as well as to train children motor nerve to become more active. This application is developed using Unity 3D. It utilizes multiple sensors such as gyroscope, accelerometer and also GPS to support location-based Augmented Reality technology. Methods that used to design this application are Hierarchy Plus Diagram Input Process Output (HIPO) and Flowchart. System testing is done using black-box testing, sampling method to obtain exact amount of testers, behavioral observation and interview. The result is showing 100% positive response from the tester. They claimed to be glad and enthusiastic to learn math using this game.},

abstract = {Digital game-based learning (DGBL) includes various features. On the other hand, diversities exist among learners. Accordingly, each learner may appreciate different game features. Thus, there is a need to examine how individual differences affect learners' reactions to DGBL. Among various individual differences, the levels of gaming experience, which are associated with playing skills, have important effects. Thus, this study developed a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG)-based English learning environment and investigated how the levels of gaming experience affected learners' reactions to the developed MMORPG. A total of 45 sixth graders from an elementary school in northern Taiwan participated in this study and they were divided into high gaming-experience learners (HGEL) and low gaming-experience learners (LGEL) based on the participants' responses to a prior gaming experience questionnaire. A mixed method was employed to analyze both learners' quantitative log data and qualitative interview responses. The results from quantitative log data showed that the HGEL had better game achievement and higher game socialization than the LGEL, especially in terms of buying items, chatting, and teaming up with friends. Conversely, the LGEL needed more in-game assistance than the HGEL, especially for checking the task list and route map. The results from qualitative interview responses showed that the HGEL skipped most of the learning content while the LGEL paid full attention to the learning content. These findings demonstrate the understandings of the effects of individual differences, especially the levels of gaming experience, on learners’ reactions to DGBL. Based on such findings, we contribute to developing a framework and several design solutions, which can be used to implement personalized DGBL to accommodate the needs of learners with different levels of gaming experience.}
