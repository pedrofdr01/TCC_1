abstract = {Besides the long-ago established importance of gameplay as a privileged framework for learning and socialization, which promotes equality alongside with acceptance of differences, motivation through challenge and absence of punishment in the case or errors, modern digital games enjoy a number of additional features such as their enhanced capability to simulate real-world and everyday-life situations in a straightforward fashion, as well as their ability to attract player's engagement through augmented playability mechanisms and balanced game feedback. All these features make digital games a most promising learning tool, in both formal and informal settings and for general and special education alike.This keynote talk will revolve around research practices and initiatives in the area of computer-based learning, conducted by the New Technologies Laboratory in Communication, Education and the Mass Media of the University of Athens. Major emphasis will be placed on the defined learning framework for a specialized formation program for primary, secondary and special education teachers supporting students with mild mental retardation (MMR) and on the research and development, along the lines of this framework, of digital games-based learning (DGBL) material for MMR students deployed and tested within the special classroom, as part of practical seminars and hands-on activities. This work is conducted in the context of the EPINOISI R&D project (http://www.media.uoa.gr/epinoisi).The digital games-based material for MMR students currently under development within the EPINOISI project is based on game applications already available as well as developed from scratch, covering subject matter relevant to language and mathematics skills for everyday life, interpersonal relations and communication, acquaintance with adult life, selected topics from the curriculum of secondary special education, as well as digital creative activities.},

abstract = {Pervasive Games Based Learning Systems (PGBLSs) are large scale systems because they operate in highly dynamic environments. They are closely related to the context which exhibits a diverse array of frequent changes and produce interactive and dynamic information. When developing such systems, it is very important to thoroughly consider users' requirements. Rapid changes in player/learner preferences makes pre-specified requirements inappropriate. To overcome these shortcomings, PGBLSs developers need sophisticated Analysis techniques. This paper presents a game theory based approach to analyze and prioritize requirements illustrated by a manual and an automatic analysis process. Our proposal is demonstrated with a simple case study.},

abstract = {Learning games that address targeted curriculum areas are widely used in schools. Within games, productive learning episodes can result from breakdowns when followed by a breakthrough, yet their role in children's learning has not been investigated. This paper examines the role of game and instructional design during and after breakdowns. We observed 26 young children playing several popular learning games and conducted a moment-by-moment analysis of breakdown episodes. Our findings show children achieve productive breakthroughs independently less than half of the time. In particular, breakdowns caused by game actions are difficult for children to overcome independently and prevent engagement with the domain skills. Importantly, we identify specific instructional game components and their role in fostering strategies that result in successful breakthroughs. We conclude with intrinsic and extrinsic instructional design implications for both game designers and primary teachers to better enable children's games-based learning.},

abstract = {Successful computer programming education is facing significant problems even nowadays for both students and teachers. To this end, the specificities of those difficulties and the corresponding causes continue to be an ongoing topic of research. According to relevant case studies, these relate to the complex concepts of computer programming as well as the lack of motivation by students to achieve the given goals. On the other hand, the emerging field of Games Based Learning is gradually delivering games that are applied in a series of educational contexts. In this paper, we aim to initially investigate the educational games developed for and used in the computer programming domain and review to which level they address the aforementioned difficulties. Related work includes a number of games that have been developed towards this goal. However, even though they seem promising examples, they lack features that would allow them to successfully underpin computer programming learning by facing the majority of the identified problems. To this end, we propose a new, advanced Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) that includes the facilitating and positive features identified in existing solutions and incorporates missing elements that will bring forth a new generation of educational games for introductory computer programming.},

Traditional IL education approach is low in efficiency. Computer games have become an influential force in people's life, and have great potentials in education. How to design and develop computer games to implement more efficient IL education is still not fully studied. This study reviews the previous literature in the field of game studies, educational function of games, game-based learning and IL education, and identifies the key issues of computer games-based IL education. Based upon the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education of the US, a model of the design and development of computer games for IL education is proposed, which includes 10 instructional modules and 6 difficulty levels.},

abstract = {Reflection is a critical aspect of the learning process. However, educational games tend to focus on supporting learning concepts rather than supporting reflection. While reflection occurs in educational games, the educational game design and research community can benefit from more knowledge of how to facilitate player reflection through game design. In this paper, we examine educational programming games and analyze how reflection is currently supported. We find that current approaches prioritize accuracy over the individual learning process and often only support reflection post-gameplay. Our analysis identifies common reflective features, and we develop a set of open areas for future work. We discuss these promising directions towards engaging the community in developing more mechanics for reflection in educational games. },

abstract = {One of the methods of learning which considered effective is to apply technology as instructional media. Let alone viewing at the current phenomenon where elementary students have been able to operate gadgets such as smartphone and tablet. They use gadget to play games, but it tends to be less useful and make them lazy. This behavior could bring a negative impact on their achievements at school. In addition, this behavior also can inhibit children motor neurons development. Based on this phenomenon, a research is made to develop a game based learning application entitled Digital Game Based Learning using Augmented Reality (for Mathematics Learning. This application is developed as one of instructional media alternative. The purpose of this application is to sharpen counting ability as well as to train children motor nerve to become more active. This application is developed using Unity 3D. It utilizes multiple sensors such as gyroscope, accelerometer and also GPS to support location-based Augmented Reality technology. Methods that used to design this application are Hierarchy Plus Diagram Input Process Output (HIPO) and Flowchart. System testing is done using black-box testing, sampling method to obtain exact amount of testers, behavioral observation and interview. The result is showing 100% positive response from the tester. They claimed to be glad and enthusiastic to learn math using this game.},

To better suit these preferences, and to improve CS educational techniques, teaching methods and tools outside of the traditional lecture sessions and textbooks must be explored and implemented. Currently, both serious games and collaborative classroom work, including pair programming, are the focus of studies meant to do just this. The proposed work deals with both serious games and student collaboration research, positing that educational games with collaborative elements (multiplayer games) will take advantage of the benefits offered by each of these areas, resulting in an educational game that demonstrates increased learning gains and student engagement above that of individual learning game experiences. Collaborative educational games and software also have the potential to solve many of the problems that collaborative work may pose to course instructors in terms of helping to regulate and evaluate student performance.},

A literature review of age-related changes and games for seniors indicated 'casual games' have the characteristics necessary to provide an enjoyable user experience for the senior audience. Having concluded that these games should target cognitive stimulation, the authors analysed mechanisms to achieve this purpose and compiled them into a matrix to be used as a starting point for the games design process. In parallel, the authors also gathered seniors' preferences and requirements regarding games, through observations and a game book. Low-, medium-, and high-fidelity prototypes for a gaming cognitive platform were developed, evaluated with end-users, and iteratively improved. Results showed that seniors easily interacted with the platform and were willing to use it in the future. Results and experience led to the identification of 10 rules of thumb that can be beneficial if applied to related projects. This paper concludes by identifying exciting areas for future research and development.},

abstract = {Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can be used to design game-based learning systems because it has the excellent ability of concept representation and reasoning. However, it can not (1) get new knowledge from existing data and (2) correct false transcendental knowledge by itself, which mars the game-based learning ability. This paper utilizes Hebbian learning rule to solve the first problem and uses unbalance degree to solve the second problem. As a result, the improved FCM has the ability of self-learning from both existing data and priori knowledge, and is more suitable for a game-based learning system. Based on the improved FCM, a novel game-based learning model is proposed, including a teacher submodel, a learner submodel and a set of learning mechanisms. The teacher submodel has the standard answers which can be deduced from the improved FCM. The learner submodel is bulit and adjusted according to the teacher's FCM, which reflects the learner's learning process. The learning mechanisms compute the difference between the outputs of the teacher submodel and the learner submodel, and control the whole game learning process according to the difference. Based on the proposed model, an automobile driving learning system is developed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our model validity in terms of controlling the learning process and the guiding learners learning.},

abstract = {Recent studies indicate that traditional instructional methods may not be as effective for the current and future generation of learners. Given the increasing amounts of time that students spend playing video games, educators have been looking at using games to enhance teaching and learning. Research indicates that games have the potential to improve learning. However there is lack of empirical data on their effectiveness, particularly in a formal educational setting at the college level. In this paper we present preliminary results from a pilot project to develop an educational game prototype on the subject of basic digital design, to be used in various digital systems courses at the undergraduate level. Our findings indicate that the game has the potential to improve student learning in and attitude toward digital design and electrical engineering. Further development of the game and additional studies are planned to obtain more conclusive results.},

In our outreach programs using the VBL, we noted that the students avoid using complex functions such as iteration, instead creating designs one point or line at a time. To motivate students to learn the advanced concepts, we created the BeadLoom Game by adding game elements to the VBL. We have tested the BeadLoom Game with two summer camps and found that the game motivates students, exposes them to more complex computing-related math concepts, and increases the chance that students will continue using the tool beyond assigned class time.},

While motion-based video games have demonstrated great potential of encouraging physical activity among nondisabled players, the accessibility of motion-based games is limited for persons with mobility disabilities, thus also limiting access to the potential health benefits of playing these games. In our work, we address this issue through the design of wheelchair-accessible motion-based game controls. We present KINECTWheels, a toolkit designed to integrate wheelchair movements into motion-based games. Building on the toolkit, we developed Cupcake Heaven, a wheelchair-based video game designed for older adults using wheelchairs, and we created Wheelchair Revolution, a motion-based dance game that is accessible to both persons using wheelchairs and nondisabled players. Evaluation results show that KINECTWheels can be applied to make motion-based games wheelchair-accessible, and that wheelchair-based games engage broad audiences in physically stimulating play. Through the application of the wheelchair as an enabling technology in games, our work has the potential of encouraging players of all ages to develop a positive relationship with their wheelchair.},

Usually though, this learning is done before the game ships, and it cannot compensate for any exploits a character discovers. One reason for this is that game publishers do not want to risk having the non-player characters making odd decisions in games that learn. In this paper we propose an approach that can be used to quickly jump-start the learning process in a game that uses a neural network to learn. We create different environments that might occur in a game, analyse them and come up with a starting point that allows the agents to quickly be able to accomplish their goals, which in our case is navigating through a random board.},

To expand the potential for competition models in game-based learning, this study proposes the notion of surrogate competition, which eliminates direct competition between students. Such surrogates could be employed as buffers so that the competition between students is more relaxed. To explore the possible benefits of a surrogate approach to competition, the My-Pet-My-Arena system has been developed and evaluated. Two empirical studies were conducted to examine the effects of the surrogate competition. The results revealed that surrogate competition enhanced students’ learning achievement as well as increased their motivation. Furthermore, the surrogate competition might also assist students in attributing competitive failures to a lack of effort. Working from the results obtained in these two studies, a general model of surrogate competition is proposed to help designers implement forms of surrogate competition in other systems for game-based learning.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a design methodology that we have termed Minimalist Game Design. Minimalist games have small rulesets, narrow decision spaces, and abstract audiovisual representations, yet they do not compromise on depth of play or possibility space. We begin with a motivation for and definition of minimalist games, including terms such as "rules," "mechanics," "control," and "interface," and illustrate the importance of artificial design constraints. Using a number of examples, we show the strengths of minimalist game elements in systems, controls, visuals, and audio. Adhering to these constraints, these games feature a small set of mechanics and one core mechanic, while still being sufficiently deep and allowing for player exploration and performance. This depth comes from procedural methods, combinatorial complexity, probability, obfuscation, challenge, or any combination thereof. Our methodology embraces principles of holistic design, where there is no "filler," and where every element of the game contributes to the play experience in some meaningful, deliberate way.},

abstract = {Learning environments have been profoundly reshaped by pervasive technology. New educational methodologies take full advantage of ICT in a mobile customized user-friendly environment, to support learning and stimulate individuals' potential. Unfortunately, technology-enhanced learning tools are not often designed with accessibility in mind, although they can greatly benefit the personal empowerment and inclusion of special-needs people. To address this gap, a Web platform has been created for delivering accessible games to people with Down syndrome. Since personalization, orderliness and positive reinforcement are crucial to learning in these subjects, the platform offers a personalized safe environment for learning, conforming to behavioral analysis principles. Learning analytics are incorporated in the platform for easy monitoring of student progress via Web interfaces. The participatory design driving the development of the learning platform allowed the customization of the games' discriminative stimuli, difficulty levels and reinforcement, as well as the creation of a game "engine" to easily set up new personalized exercises. These customization features make the game platform usable by a larger audience, including individuals with learning difficulties and autism.},

abstract = {Digital games are becoming increasingly popular with the latest generation of consoles bringing games to an even wider audience [20]. Academic interest in the educational potential of video games is also growing and seems to stem from the fact that they are considered motivating [10; 13]. However, while there is some research on what makes games engaging, there is a need to further our understanding of the link between player involvement and learning, and to develop methods to evaluate these aspects of the user experience. This paper aims to report on a study that explored this relationship through a qualitative case-study approach. The methods consisted of a combination of observed game-play and a post-play cued interview in which a video recording of the game-play was reviewed. The Digital Game Experience Model [1; 2] was then used to analyse critical instances and themes within these episodes. Two examples are presented to illustrate how the method was implemented. The findings indicate a very close relationship between learning and involvement and suggest that a certain amount of learning is required before deeper levels of involvement can be experienced. However, further research is required in order to see whether these findings can be generalised and to consider whether different forms of interaction can be incorporated into this model of game play.},

However, it is often difficult to instrument game mechanics so that they can be controlled to promote learning. Furthermore, even if this parameterization is possible, there is little knowledge of how to generate adaptive level progressions that optimize engagement and learning. We have taken the first step towards enabling adaptivity in an educational game for teaching fractions through the automatic generation of levels in a way that allows for multiple axes of mathematical and spatial difficulty to be controlled independently. We propose to expand on this work by developing a framework for representing conceptual knowledge. This framework will keep track of each player's knowledge, generate game levels that are tailored to the player's knowledge and skill level, and create progressions of these levels that allow players to learn new concepts through experimentation. We will compare multiple adaptive concept sequencing algorithms by evaluating their effects on player learning and engagement through multivariate tests with tens of thousands of players.},

We also present results from an initial study of the educational impact of the game. Many educational games do not properly translate knowledge, facts, and lessons into the language of games. This results in games that are often neither engaging nor educational. Our approach differs by using game mechanics to express the educational content. The design combines the fantasy elements and game play conventions of the real-time strategy (RTS) genre with numbers, resources and situations based on research about real-world energy production and use. The result is a game in which the player learns about energy use simply by trying to overcome the game's challenges. We demonstrate that effective and engaging learning games can be developed as long as sound game design principles are used. Results from a combined quantitative/qualitative study show that players enjoyed the game, learned new things and became more interested in the topic of energy use. This paper will highlight key aspects of the design that we believe contributed towards making the game fun as well as educational. The game also presents a model for translating real-world topics into game mechanics using the language of procedural rhetoric. The real world is ripe with problems and situations that could inspire interesting game mechanics and provide new creative ideas for educational and traditional game designers.},

In addition, many aspects of gaming can also be used in an introductory course using robots.

abstract = {A recent body of experimental literature has studied empirical game-theoretical analysis, in which we have partial knowledge of a game, consisting of observations of a subset of the pure-strategy profiles and their associated payoffs to players. The aim is to find an exact or approximate Nash equilibrium of the game, based on these observations. It is usually assumed that the strategy profiles may be chosen in an on-line manner by the algorithm. We study a corresponding computational learning model, and the query complexity of learning equilibria for various classes of games. We give basic results for exact equilibria of bimatrix and graphical games. We then study the query complexity of approximate equilibria in bimatrix games. Finally, we study the query complexity of exact equilibria in symmetric network congestion games. For directed acyclic networks, we can learn the cost functions (and hence compute an equilibrium) while querying just a small fraction of pure-strategy profiles. For the special case of parallel links, we have the stronger result that an equilibrium can be identified while only learning a small fraction of the cost values.},

abstract = {Game jams have grown as a democratized game development process, imitating on several days the production of the AAA-industry. However, the current format of the mainstream game jams does not give the possibilities to learn how to work in a big production or to emulate correctly the feeling to be in a big team, because the team size tend to oscillate between a solo team to maximum ten participants. In countries like Switzerland, there is no AAA-industry that employs hundreds of developers at the same time. For those kinds of experience, game developers and game designers have to "export" themselves out of those countries, making it a harder experience to live.In 2015, the two main game developers' linguistic communities of Switzerland tried two different experiments answering this question: "How can we bring together the different talents at disposal to create one game?". The Swiss-French game developers' community answered with an indie game jam with a team of 26 developers, the I3 Game Jam. The Swiss-German game developers' community answered with an academic workshop of three weeks with a pre-defined game concept, the Swiss Mercenaries Workshop.From those two approaches, the authors formalize and theorize what is a Big Team Game Jam and their different key elements compared to standard game jams: Target Group, Hierarchy, Participants Motivation, Ownership, and Duration. This paper explores those two solutions, their community context, and gives a framework for countries like Switzerland without a AAA-industry to emulate those productions at very low-cost.},

abstract = {This study explores the use of game design and its impact on content learning, understanding and retention of knowledge, in information literacy classes. Information literacy (IL) concept is considered critical in a growing number of social and academic contexts. Despite the importance of IL many learners still have little idea how to evaluate information for relevance, accuracy or authority and are generally uncritical about messages offered to them through online media. The discourse on the use of games as a platform for library orientations and instruction is increasingly addressed in the current practitioner oriented literature. However, very few learning programs offer the design component. This quasi-experimental study uses a pre-test/post-test design. The sample is a non-probability convenience sample of undergraduate students. Findings show that students were able to design functional games using various game design characteristics. This study has the potential of creating new knowledge about the incorporation of learning by game design specific to higher education and libraries.},

The participants will present research findings that highlight similarities and differences in tools, pedagogies, purposes, and outcomes of game design activities. Game design is often presumed to be appealing to learners who ordinarily might not be motivated to learn through traditional instruction, and we will give particular attention to the significance of race, class, and gender in student engagement and learning through design.},
